        Jerusalem (CNN)Israel carried out a series of airstrikes early Monday against Iranian targets in Syria, the
        Israeli military said, in response to an Iranian missile fired at the Golan Heights, capping off a volatile 24
        hours between the two regional enemies with the possibility of more fighting ahead.

        The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) struck Iranian targets in and around Damascus, including the city's
        international airport, IDF Spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said. The overnight strikes targeted munitions
        depots, intelligence sites, a training camp and more, Conricus said.
        The IDF also struck Iranian warehouses at the Damascus International Airport, Conricus said, noting that Israel
        observed secondary explosions, indicating that weapons had been hit.

        Israel also attacked Syrian anti-aircraft batteries when those batteries fired dozens of missiles at Israeli
        aircraft carrying out the strikes, Conricus said. Israel relayed a message to Syria that the military was only
        targeting Iranian forces and warned Syria not to fire at Israeli jets.
        The wide-ranging strikes were in response to a medium range surface-to-surface missile fired toward the
        Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Sunday afternoon. The missile was made by Iran and launched by Iranian
        forces, Conricus said, adding that it's the first time a missile with such a payload has been fired by Iranian
        forces at Israel.
        The missile was fired from an area near Damascus, Conricus said, which is approximately 50 kilometers from the
        Golan Heights. Russia had assured Israel that no Iranian forces would be this close to Israel, according to
        Conricus.

        Russian state media agency RIA-Novosti reported four Syrian soldiers were killed and another six wounded in the
        Israeli strikes, citing Russia's defense control center.
        The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said 11 were killed in the strike, including 2
        Syrian nationals. The SOHR described the Israeli attack as the "most intense and violent attack against the
        regime forces and their allies in terms of casualties since May 2018," when Israel carried out a large-scale
        attack on Iranian targets in Syria following dozens of rockets launched from Syria toward Israel. Israel
        accused Iran of firing the rockets.
        But Iran's state-run FARS news agency denied that any casualties had taken place and reported that Syrian air
        defenses managed to intercept seven Israeli missiles fired into Syrian territory.
