        Installing the NPM Packages
        To process the package.json file to download and install the packages that it specifies, run the following
        command inside the todo folder:
        npm install
        You will see some warnings as NPM grumbles about the packages it processes, but there should be no
        errors reported. Once the installation process has completed, you will be left with a todo/node_modules
        directory that contains all the packages specified in the package.json file, along with their dependencies.
        There will be a lot of packages in the node_modules folder because the tendency in NPM development is to
        build on existing functionality that other packages contain, which is good development practice but does
        mean the initial download and installation can take a while.
        Configuring the TypeScript Compiler
        Angular applications are written in TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. Working with TypeScript
        provides some useful advantages, which I describe in Chapter 6, but requires that TypeScript files are
        processed to generate backward-compatible JavaScript that can be used by browsers.
        Note Don’t worry about the requirement to use TypeScript for the moment. As I explain in Chapter 6, it
        simplifies working with Angular and, with just a few exceptions, you can write Angular applications using the
        JavaScript skills you already have.
        The TypeScript compiler requires a configuration file to control the kind of JavaScript files that it
        generates. I created a file called tsconfig.json in the todo folder and added the configuration statements
        shown in Listing 2-2.
        Listing 2-2. The Contents of the tsconfig.json File in the todo Folder
        In the next section, I’ll remove the HTML from the file, cut it up into smaller pieces, and use it to create
        a simple Angular application.
        USING THE BOOTSTRAP PRE-RELEASE
        Throughout this book, I use a pre-release version of the Bootstrap CSS framework. As I write this, the
        Bootstrap team is in the process of developing Bootstrap version 4 and has made several early releases.
        These releases have been labeled as “alpha,” but the quality is high and they are stable enough for usePutting
        the Application Together
        I have the three key pieces of functionality required to build a simple Angular application: a model, a
        template, and a component. Now I need to bring them together to create the application.
        The first step is to create an Angular module. Through an unfortunate naming choice, there are
        two types of module used inThe [ngSwitch] expression is a conditional statement that is used to insert different
        sets of elements
        into the document based on a specified value, which is the item.done property in this case. Nested within
        the td element are two span elements that have been annotated with *ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault
        and that are equivalent to the case and default keywords of a regular JavaScript switch block. I describe
        ngSwitch in detail in Chapter 13 (and what the square brackets mean in Chapter 12), but the result is that
        the first span element is added to the document when the value of the item.done property is true and the
        second span element is added to the document when item.done is false. The result is that the true/false
        value of the item.done property is transformed into span elements containing either Yes or No. When you
        save the changes to the template, the browser will reload, and the table of to-do items will be displayed, as
        shown in Figure 2-5. Angular development. A JavaScript module is a file that contains JavaScript
        functionality that is used through the import keyword. The other type of module is an Angular module,
        which is used to describe an application or a group of related features. Every application has a root module,
        which provides Angular with the information that it needs to start the application. I created a file called app.
        module.ts, which is the conventional file name for the root module, in the todo/app folder and added the
        code shown in Listing 2-11.
        in the examples in this book.
        Given the choice of writing this book using the soon-to-be-obsolete Bootstrap 3 and a pre-release
        version of Bootstrap 4, I decided to use the new version even though some of the class names that are
        used to style HTML elements are likely to change before the final release. This means you must use
        the same version of Bootstrap to get the expected results from the examples, just like the rest of the
        packages listed in the package.json file in Listing 2-1.
        Adding Angular to the Project
        The static HTML in the index.html file acts as a placeholder for the basic application. The user should be
        able to see the list of to-do items, check off items that are complete, and create new items. In the sections
        that follow, I add Angular to the project and use some of its basic features to bring the to-do application to
        life. To keep the application simple, I assume that there is only one user and that I don’t have to worry about
        preserving the state of the data in the application, which means that changes to the to-do list will be lost if
        the browser window is closed or reloaded. (Later examples, including the SportsStore application developed
        in Chapters 7–10, demonstrate persistent data storage.)
        Preparing the HTML File
        The first step toward adding Angular to the application is to prepare the index.html file, as shown in
        Listing 2-6. The new script elements add the JavaScript files for the Angular framework, and the third-party
        JavaScript libraries and polyfill that provide compatibility for older browsers. These files are all from the
        NPM packages added to the package.json file in Listing 2-1 and must be added in the order shown.
        Listing 2-6. Preparing for Angular in the index.html File
        I explain what each configuration setting does in Chapter 11, but for now, it is enough to just create
